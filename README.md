#### Background: 
Today, music is a universal source of joy and relaxation, featuring a rich variety of popular songs that connect with audiences worldwide. More than just a pleasant sound, the blend of lyrics, rhythms, and stylistic elements plays a crucial role in a song's popularity. Artists use their unique styles, and even the song's name can greatly impact how it's received.
#### Methodology: 
Our approach involves the integration of both Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models and pre-trained models to generate lyrics. The research is structured into three distinct steps:
- Lyrics Generator with Starting Sentences: Utilizing initial sentences to generate lyrics that align with the established style of previous lyrics.
- Lyrics Generator with Artists: Employing the artist's name to generate lyrics tailored to the distinctive style of the singer.
- Lyrics Generator with Titles: Harnessing the power of titles to create lyrics that resonate with the themes encapsulated in song titles.
